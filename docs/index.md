### Welcome to Yani's page

Hello there. My name is Yani Garcia. This is an in progress web page as I try to determine what is best suited to the web page as opposed to simply copy and pasting my resume.


### About Me

I prefer the name Yani because it is easier to pronounce and remember for most people. I learned how to ride a motorcycle when I was younger because I thought it looked cool and I wanted to get one instead of a car. I enjoy cooking new recipes that I find off of the internet and spicy food.

As of Fall 2021, I am interning at MGHPCC and I hope to learn more the longer I am here. I have partially written a program to calculate values and update it in a database to handle some repetative work.
